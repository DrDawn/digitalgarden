## 🧠 Fleeting Thoughts
*(Capture random ideas, observations, insights)*
I really need to stop playing around with my Obsidian set up and get to work producing something. 
Do I really need to be spending time on this? Do I have anyone who will read this if I do publish it online? I am thinking this is really a rabbit hole I need to move on from. I can copy/export the markdown file into RStudio and add it to a site there. If it deserves being in public spaces. It seems that the new free Netlify account will let me publish a few notes each day if i really need to publish one with out the effort of adding it to a Quarto site.
