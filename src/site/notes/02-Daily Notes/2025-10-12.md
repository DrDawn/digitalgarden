## 🧠 Fleeting Thoughts
*(Capture random ideas, observations, insights)*
Watching a YT video (Master The Most PROFITABLE Way To Use Google’s FREE Tools) https://youtu.be/Pn94BkySkiU?si=KKncGP1eHqaR02jM
- shows how to create "hubs" that can be shared with the "public" using Notebook LM. Because all of the B231 Lab Manual is CC, I can safely use it in NotebookLM to create a "chatbot" I can share with students. 
Watched this YT video about using NotebookLM to capture "SEO". But in it he shows using slide by slide prompts to create the video summary : This NotebookLM SEO Trick is INSANE https://youtu.be/quFUV3sSzPs?si=wf2mF_ileFgkVe8F
- Note to use the NotebookLM video on YT you will need to add a disclosure; see https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14328491#disclose_process
