I watched several videos today on the Diary of a CEO Clips channel https://www.youtube.com/@TheDiaryOfACEOClips
- The AI Safety Expert: These Are The Only 5 Jobs That Will Remain In 2030! - Dr. Roman Yampolskiy (1:27:37) 9/4/25 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UclrVWafRAI
- The Real Reason ONLY 5 jobs will exist in 24 months (21:50) 9/9/25 https://youtu.be/FRUTFGtPeVc?si=H0d1Ej3O7rY2zfN5 
- Godfather of AI: These jobs won't exist in 24 months..." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c1xhcV9QqU 
- Godfather of AI WARNS: "You Have No Idea What's Coming" (20:57)  9/27/25 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KmopXwjXik

The "bottom line", in my opinion based on these discussions is that we in higher ed must rethink what we are teaching our students - NOW. 

**Related thought: "given" that it seems no one is serious about building in safety such that AI is under human control when it becomes super intelligent: should I reverse course and not support use of AI in Education???**
