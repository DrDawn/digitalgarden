"Learn How to Learn with AI"

**10/6/25**
Watched an "important" podcast video today: **The AI Economist: The Skill You Need to Stay Employed in the Age of AI** (1:05:30) published 10/2/25: "leading AI economist, professor and author **Ajay Agrawal** to unpack whether AI is truly overhyped or if weâ€™re fundamentally underestimating its long-term impact on the economy."
- ~ 8 minutes in: AI's impact depends upon "co-inventions" much like the impact of electricity did: the real impact required time for the economy to develop "co-inventions" which used/expanded upon the initial use of electricity. AI is much the same - we are waiting on those co-inventions.
- (30:55) Prediction vs Judgement  https://youtu.be/UhfpHwcrx6c?si=u_9HXeblIfhLmP1Y
	- AI predicts but cannot exercise judgement, so students need to be building their judgement muscle.
- (~34:00)"learning from reading" is the old paradigm of education. Now students must learn from doing: making decisions using judgement and owning the outcomes.
- (~42) an employee's job is to keep asking (of the AI) "why" did it choose that? A machine will keep doing but never has a preference - it never asks itself why.

I watched several videos today on the Diary of a CEO Clips channel https://www.youtube.com/@TheDiaryOfACEOClips
- The AI Safety Expert: These Are The Only 5 Jobs That Will Remain In 2030! - Dr. Roman Yampolskiy (1:27:37) 9/4/25 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UclrVWafRAI
- The Real Reason ONLY 5 jobs will exist in 24 months (21:50) 9/9/25 https://youtu.be/FRUTFGtPeVc?si=H0d1Ej3O7rY2zfN5 
- Godfather of AI: These jobs won't exist in 24 months..." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c1xhcV9QqU 
- Godfather of AI WARNS: "You Have No Idea What's Coming" (20:57)  9/27/25 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KmopXwjXik

The "bottom line", in my opinion based on these discussions is that we in higher ed must rethink what we are teaching our students - NOW. 

**Related thought: "given" that it seems no one is serious about building in safety such that AI is under human control when it becomes super intelligent: should I reverse course and not support use of AI in Education???**
