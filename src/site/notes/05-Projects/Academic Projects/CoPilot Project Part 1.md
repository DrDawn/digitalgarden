I spent about 2 hours with CoPilot in Excel Web and found that it is still a bit slow and does not really recognize which version of Excel (web or desktop) I was using. It kept trying to tell me to import csv files using the Data/import CSV command which the web does not have. I wasted a bunch of time figuring out on my own how to get the UnVotes data sets into Excel - had to use Claude to give me the R code but I admit CoPilot Excel Web at least was "familiar" with the UnVotes R package but could not work with it. It needs uploaded Excel files.
